SDLC:
----

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. 
The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.

Why SDLC?
---------
If we construct a house or dam. If wall of the dam gets crack, then we can see and fix it.
If the water is flowing in wrong direction, then we can fix it.
But when it comes to software development, we cannot see the results until after the but building software.

If we don't follow software methodologies then there will be huge loss on projects.

Server:
------
Generally data is stored in server. 
A server is a physical existance, where projects are deployed.
There will be seperate team to deploy the projects in servers or cloud.
